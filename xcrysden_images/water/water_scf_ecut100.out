     Parallel version (MPI), running on    12 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     5779 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
 
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      12
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
