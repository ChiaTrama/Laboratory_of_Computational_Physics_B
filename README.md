Welcome to the data repository for Tuscano Alessio's Master Thesis course LACP-B. 
This repository hosts all the data used and generated during the course.

## Overview

The course focuses on using and experimenting on common and emergent tools for data analysis for scientific purposes, such as classification, clustering, and regression of physical datasets.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- **[water_dnn/model_graphs_[scenario]]**: folders for predictions with various scenario
  - Under these folders you can find graphs for multiple neural networks predictions: every image is named with the primary hyperparameters that has been changed during the development of the final neural network, so it is easy to refer to the corresponding saved model.
- **[water_dnn/model_plots]**: folder where a given model loss function plot can be found.


## Usage

All the jupyter notebooks are written in python.
To use the neural network code you need Tensorflow with Keras and a few other packages mentioned in each notebook.
